# Below is removing subjects based on temperature. I do not think we should do this because it lowers our statistical power.
# Subjects 26, 29, and 30 have high temperatures for the SL day (greater than 1 degree difference). Let's try removing them and don't include Temperature in the model. 
# Subject 4 has a high temp for DD. 
# The question is adding tempature into the model sufficient? If so, we don't need to drop these subjects. 
# Asking a physiologist, they said slight temperature fluctuations should NOT impact energetic expenditure that much
